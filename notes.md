# Testing Goals

Uranium needs to work in a variety of situations, so testing is key. Ultimately we should be looking at:

* 100% code coverage?
* full-stack tests
* coverage across all major versions of python:
  * 2.6
  * 2.7
  * 3.5
* uranium's warmup test needs to test installation of the uranium on disk,
  not from the repo.
